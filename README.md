<h1> Student Information System [SIS]</h1>

<p>Student Information system is a webpage bulit using HTML , CSS & PHP for the 
students which will store all the information of students and 
will give them fast access to their data. The webpage will help 
the students in their college life by providing them important 
information like student info and information related to their 
department etc. As the college likes to hold many events and 
several activities are held in the college, a notice board feature 
will also be provided where such notice will be posted by the 
authorities. This feature will be similar to the notice board 
feature and the students will be categorized into department, 
year, and class so the teacher can post homework or notice for 
only a concerned few.

1. Reliability: A reliable student information system should be stable, consistent, 
and able to handle high volumes of data without errors or downtime. It should 
accurately store and retrieve student information, including grades, 
attendance records, and personal details.<br/>
2. Scalability: Scalability refers to the system's ability to handle an increasing 
number of users and data without significant performance degradation. A 
scalable student information system should accommodate growing student 
populations and support concurrent usage by administrators, teachers, and 
students.<br/>
3. Aesthetics: The aesthetics of a student information system involve its user 
interface design, graphical elements, and overall visual appeal. A well-
designed system should have an intuitive and user-friendly interface that 
enhances usability and engages users.<br/>
4. Ergonomics: Ergonomics focuses on the system's usability and how well it 
caters to users' physical and cognitive needs. A student information system 
should be designed with considerations for user comfort, efficient workflows, 
and accessibility, ensuring that users can navigate and interact with the system 
easily.<br/>
5. Cost: The cost of a student information system includes initial implementation 
expenses, licensing or subscription fees, hardware and infrastructure 
requirements, ongoing maintenance costs, and potential customization 
expenses. The cost should be evaluated in relation to the system's features, 
scalability, and long-term value.<br/>
6. Maintenance: Regular maintenance is crucial to keep the student information 
system running smoothly. It includes software updates, bug fixes, security 
patches, and database optimization. A well-maintained system minimizes 
downtime, improves performance, and ensures data integrity.<br/>
7. Modelling: Modelling refers to how the student information system represents 
and organizes data. The system should have a logical and flexible data model 
that can accommodate various types of information, relationships between 
data entities, and support customization based on specific educational 
requirements.<br/>
8. Use and Reuse: The system should support a wide range of functionalities for 
different stakeholders, such as administrators, teachers, students, and parents. 
It should allow users to access relevant information easily, generate reports, 
manage enrollments, track academic progress, communicate effectively, and 
facilitate collaboration. Additionally, a good system can offer reusable 
components or integrations with other educational tools and systems.<br/>
9. Sustainability: A sustainable student information system takes into account 
long-term environmental and social impacts.<br/>
